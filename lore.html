                In one scene, for a few seconds, a person is seen crossing in front 
                of the camera with a bike. This person was a previous victim of baghead, 
                who is trying to enjoy their afterlife doing what they loved, riding bikes.

            <p>
                He had been working there for 4 years prior, and had never noticed 
                baghead because he had been brainwashed by him.

                If you paid very close attention to the background in a certain scene,
                you will see the bag that baghead wears. The question is, where is
                baghead, and who could he be...
