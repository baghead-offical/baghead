		<p id="story">
			The mysterious &quot;Baghead&quot; has been terrorizing the town of Medford Oregon. Its latest victim was 			Adrian Blackwood, a 29-year-old male who worked at a cafeteria. Authorities say this wasnâ€™t the only 
			victim either, there has been 9 other victims in the past; all which had been victims in cases where the 
			killer was never found. However, new evidence suggests there may be a connection between these cases. Part 
			of such evidence being an eyewitness that reported there was one person standing in the surroundings of the 
			crime scene. We think this person is a former victim of the baghead.

		<h2>Official Word</h2>
		<p id="offical">
			Currently, officials say they have had little luck with this case, and have been unable to find any 
			helpful witnesses, as baghead leaves behind little evidence. Officials also say that if you know 
			anything at all about who this &quot;Baghead&quot; may be, that you should contact them immediately.
