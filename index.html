		<p id="story">
			The mysterious &quot;baghead&quot; has been terrorizing the town of
			Medford Oregon. It&apos;s latest victim was Adrian Blackwood, a 29 year
			old male who worked at a cafeteria. Authorities say this isn&apos;t the
			only victim either, there has been 9 other victims in the past all of
			which had been victims in cases where the killer was never found however,
			new evidence suggests there may be a connection between these cases. Part
			of such evidence being an eye witness that reported there was one person
			standing in the surroundings of the crime scene. We think this person is
			a former victim of baghead.

		<h2>Offical Word</h2>
		<p id="offical">
			Currently, officals say they have had little luck with this case, and have been unable
			to find any helpful witnesses, as baghead leaves little left of his victms. Officals 
			also say that if you know anything at all about who this &quot;baghead&quot; may be, 
			that you should contact them immediately.
